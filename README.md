# VoiceAttack-Wizard101
VoiceAttack profiles for Wizard101.

These profiles require the paid version of VoiceAttack.

## Note to self:
- Can probably develop different profiles for different situations then switch between them. Also could probably select cards with macro-like voice commands (e.g. "select 1" would do the first card offered in battle).

## Conclusions:
I created this profile out of curiosity. What I discovered was, while it seemed to initially work, wizard 1O1 seems to block non-human input sometimes, and thus it causes it to work inconsistently. E.g. When finishing a battle "walk" will no longer work but it normally does. Furthermore, "mouse left 3" worked for most of my testing but later on all mouse directional voice commands stopped working. Furthermore, Wizard101 is not very accessible. You cannot tab through options or use keyboard- it REQUIRES a mouse.

The only way I could bypass using a mouse was having Talon voice software paired with Tobii's head/eye tracking software. This actually worked inside Wizard101 to select the cards during battle (normally it does not work in games). However, W101 still blocks too much for accessibility to make it possible to play entirely Without a keyboard or mouse. 

Lastly, games that require walking around the world don't really work (fully) with VoiceAttack because the level of control required. It's much more effective with parrot.py probably where you can Make a sound and stop whenever to represent keep going left until I stop making X sound. However, with voice commands the best you can do is turn X degrees left, turn Y degrees right, etc etc.
